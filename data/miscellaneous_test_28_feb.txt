He then started propaganda through the press.To this end, he launched a monthly magazine in Punjabi, the Kirti, the first issue of which was published from Amritsar in February 1926. The journal became the mouthpiece of the Kirti Kisan Sabha. Bhai Santokh Singh was helped in his work, which was first carried on secretly, by Bhag Singh Canadian, who was cofounder with Santokh Singh of the Kirti, Karam Singh Chima, Baba Vasakha Singh and Kartar Singh of Latala. The Kirti Kisan Sabha was declared unlawful under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908, vide notification No. 124675B, dated 10 September 1934. The Sabha ceased to exist thereafter but the movement assumed other names and continued with the task it had taken upon itself. \n"
