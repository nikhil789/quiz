            "stmts": [
                "Not depending on short-term foreign borrowings",

                "1, 2 and 3"
            ],
            "correct": "1 only",
            "explanation": "The Short-term debts have to be returned at a shorter interval. This renders an economy vulnerable if the economy is already facing economic crisis as it has an obligation to return the debt as well as interest payments. + Opening up to the foreign banks and depending upon them is not a good idea during crisis. Foreign banks reduced their lending during crisis. Many of them choose to retreat from cross-border banking in general + Capital account convertibility would mean that there is no restriction on conversion of the domestic currency into a foreign currency. Any deterioration in fiscal conditions, inflation management, balance of payments, or any other economic crisis may cause a cessation or reversal of capital flows."

            ],
            "correct": "to leave it unchanged",
            "explanation": "Basic components of money supply are: Currency with public (C) Demand Deposits of public with Banks (also called as deposit money) (D). we can express money supply as: M= C+D. Now, taking out Rs 1 lakh from \"D\" would increase \"C\" with public. This simply means that \"the immediate\" effect would be \"a no change in the aggregate money supply\" in the economy."

            ],
            "correct": "It is a largely non-debt creating capital flow.",
            "explanation": "A debt flow is a type of foreign capital where there is obligation for the residents to repay it. A non-debt flow is the one where there is no direct repayment obligation for theresidents. For example, in the case of FDI, there is not debt payment obligation. On the other hand, in the case of External Commercial Borrowings that is a loan taken by residents from abroad, the loan is to be repaid and this is a debt flow. When the capital inflow is a debt flow like External Commercial Borrowings or NRI deposits, it means debt payment obligation for the country. FDI and Depository Receipts are non-debt flows."
